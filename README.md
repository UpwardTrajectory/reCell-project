# reCell-project

This repo contains the raw data & finished notebook after walking through Linear Regression w/ my cohort.   
  
Note: If this breaks any code sharing policies, please contact me and I will set this repo to private. This was the easiest & fastest way to share my code w/ my students, and it allowed me to give them a quick demo in 'Git Fundamentals' at the same time.

This notebook and data was provided from MLS #3 found here: https://olympus.greatlearning.in/courses/44502/
